# Xiaomi Redmi 9A/9C
This is a Halium 10 based port for the Xiaomi Redmi 9A and 9C.
To get this booting you *must* be on the latest Android 10 firmware for your device (MIUI 12.0.19 for 9A and 12.0.22 for 9C as of now).

While LineageOS 17 might work, it is strongly recommended that you flash the stock firmware so that any unexpected bugs do not occur.
Links for the firmware for both 9A (dandelion) and 9C (angelica/angelican) are given below:
